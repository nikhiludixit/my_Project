      <p>Through the ignition and combustion of a 15:1 air-fuel mix, the ICE engine converts thermal energy into mechanical energy and emits waste exhaust gases in the process. Improvements in efficiency and evolving emission standards, ICE technology has not changed much in the last 100 years.

        There are hundreds of moving parts with tight tolerances that must work together to keep the combustion engine running. When the combustion process starts you can hear and feel the vibrations in the vehicle caused by the mechanical and hydraulic systems.CE engines produce power in a limited speed range and use gears to maintain acceleration. Fuel keeps burning as long as the engine is switched on, even when the car is idling.

        Electrical powertrains convert electrical energy (stored in the battery), into mechanical energy which turns the motor, rotating the wheels. EVs have 90% fewer moving parts than ICE vehicles.</p>

      <p> Trends like Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) connectivity and energy-efficient powertrain solutions are fueling the demand for centralized control of vehicle functions. This in turn is driving up the need for highly efficient and heterogeneous multicore processors and a forward-looking OS that can handle this increasing load.

        To meet these changing needs, software experts are designing a flexible software architecture. Doing so will help meet the demand for seamless communication among different hardware components. As a result, the software will support faster processing, improved efficiency, and scalability to add new applications and mapping. </p>

  <div class="o-header">Global EV Sales for 2023</div>
  <p class="online-sales">
Global EV sales continued as expected by us at the beginning of 2023. A total of 14,2 million new Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV) were delivered during 2023, an increase of +35 %. 10 million were pure electric BEVs and 4,2 million were Plug-in Hybrids (PHEV) and Range Extender EVs (EREV).

Media reporting that EV adoption is in reverse is not evident in our monthly tracking. Global deliveries of BEVs and PHEVs increased by 3,66 million units over 2022 and all monthly sales were between 8 % and 52 % higher than in the year previous. 5 months of 2023 witnessed new all-time highs for EV sales, Market share increases were consistent throughout the year. The exception was Germany, Europe's largest EV market, where a series of significant cuts in EV grants lead to s decline in EV sales and market shares.  European EV registration were up by a meager +17 % vs 2022; excluding Germany, the increase was +32 %. China EV sales increased by +36 % in 2023 y/y, EV sales in USA and Canada were +46 % higher than the year previous.  EV sales outside the aforementioned markets increased by +81 %, albeit from a low base.

In most countries the EV increases were accompanied by a strong recovery in overall light vehicle markets, increasing by +10,5 % globally. EV adoption does not follow auto market slumps and recoveries in lockstep. Successful EV launches, financial incentives, improving charging infrastructure and environmentalism are stronger forces. Slowing overall auto sales typically lead to faster EV share increases while strong auto market recoveries slow down EV share gains.

EV shares still continued to increase in most markets. BEVs (11,1 %) and PHEVs (4,7 %) stood for 15,8 % of global light vehicle sales in 2023, compared to 13,0 % in 2022. Norway had the highest market share of EVs in 2023 (BEVs 72 % + PHEVs 7 %), followed by Hong Kong and the Nordic countries in Europe. China had 33,9 %, Europe 21,4 % and USA 9,4 %. The fastest growing markets were Turkey with 86 600 units, up +805 %, Brazil with 50 400 units, up +359 %, Thailand with 89 000 units, up +328 %, Malaysia with 10 400 BEV & PHEV units, +886 % and Australia with 93 00 units, up +141 %.

PHEVs stood for 29,6 % in the global BEV-PHEV mix in 2023 compared to 27,2 % in 2022, a deviation from the long-term trend. The PHEV volume increase was 1,33 million units, most of it (1,2m) in China. High sales of BYD PHEVs and the renaissance of Range Extender Electric Vehicles (EREVs) are the main reason. EREVs have larger batteries and longer all-electric range than PHEVs, carrying a small petrol engine as a "back-up" generator. The Chevrolet Volt and the BMW i3 were early examples of this concept, the current EREV leader is Li Motor with 376 000 units delivered in 2023. Total EREV sales were 705 900 units, of which 98 % in were sold in China. Sales of Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCEV) in the light vehicle sector have declined by -38 % vs 2022 and stayed below 10 000 units annually. Current sales are from five vehicle models and most sales are in South Korea and USA. We estimate their current population to be about 60000 units.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. Electric Vehicle Dealership Business Plan:</strong> 
        <p class="marketing-details">Dealerships are influential industry leaders for the efficient introduction and infrastructure of electric vehicles. They are the first point of communication with the user in the electric vehicles diaspora.A dealer may also be a workplace where their workers who drive electric vehicles have an electric system. Sales workers will also switch from one distributor to another. A dealer's values, the Management Officer, Finance and Insurance Officers, Service Managers, and Technicians, are the prominent people in a dealer who can affect electric vehicles’ purchasing.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2. How to Start an Electric Vehicle Dealership?:</strong>
        <p class="marketing-details">Analyse the market, research what product is liked by the customers, and analyse the demand. You must remember how your business could draw some of your customers' demand while evaluating the demand.

Each corporation must recognise its ideal client. Your perfect client is a list of the qualities that the best customers share. You should plan your company to suit your needs by determining the perfect buyer.

The purpose of your market research for dealerships is to decide whether your commodity has adequate demand. Finally, you have to consider how much you can attract your goods and your buyers’ demand from the market revenue.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3. Electric Car Dealership Opportunities In India:</strong>
        <p class="marketing-details">Sales representatives can meet with the clients on the phone, online, or in-person. They should tell you about the time of charging, battery time, or electric vehicle range of a specific electric car.
One rank above the sales employees, which is generally concluded and figures addressed. Your goal is to agree. The sales manager is typically the ultimate judge on the price of the vehicle.

The finance manager establishes the deal and funding. The Finance Manager can add additional options or facilities, such as warranties or goods, at this point.

At the dealership, the highest floor would be the Manager. They can also make choices on investments in infrastructure for electric vehicles. Their prominent job is to talk to the suppliers. They can also have shared, either as a sole proprietor or member of a broader community, in the dealership.

Usually, hybrid vehicles need minimum maintenance - based on whether they are plug-in vehicles or all-electric. At some stage, the technician will consult with the customer and provide feedback on the electric vehicle’s necessary care. Also, to get more details or buy a Level 2 charging station, a customer can visit the parts & support workers.

The infrastructure for electric vehicles involves important players beyond the environment of automakers. Main participants include suppliers, dealers, electricians, and users of electric vehicle supply equipment. The manufacture of electric vehicles also conducts rigorous research for the automaker, including compatibility, optimal charging time measurement, department testing, and field testing. Electrical distribution, retail dealers, or vendors of vehicle parts and equipment may be part of the dealer. The electrical contractor can be part of a company, franchise, or independent of a wider group. Many of the stakeholders in the supply chain rely on the manufacturer of EV's for training: sales bulletins, video, customer support, instruction.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>4. Requirements For Electric Vehicles Dealership:</strong>
        <p class="marketing-details">A showroom of around 1500-2000 square ft. You require a service area of 5 bays. Another investment for room and infrastructure could set you back. They need a yard to carry a month's product. You could get a mortgage on the property.

The desire to purchase a month's inventory. Around investment will be required for this. Banks can give you loans to purchase stock, with the stock being the collateral. Hire a good Team of at least 15 people—the need to hire persons directly from the GM to the cleaning workers.

Need to provide adequate money to pay running costs, such as employment, power, generator, and over a minimum duration of 6 months. To meet the break-even expectations, have good marketing staff.</p>
